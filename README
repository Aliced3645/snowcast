Snowcast Readme - By Shu Zhang (szhang)

snowcast_server:

	Usage: To start the server, we can type: snowcast_server [listening port] [songs dir path 1] [songs dir path 2] ... [songs dir path n]
		   Each songs dir path corresponds to a station, containing all songs to be played. DO NOT INCLUDE THE LAST '/' IN THE PATH. 
		   For example, we can type: [./snowcast_server 8080 ./mp3_1 ./mp3_2] to start the server.

		   When having started the server, the server supports some command line input for extended functions.
		   Type:
		  	 'c' : To display all connected clients information.(IP Address, port, listening stations)
			 'p' : To display all stations with the songs they are playing and clients connected to them.
			 'q' : To exit the server program.
			 's' : To display all songs for each station.( Including all songs to be played )
			 'a [songs dir path]' : To dynamically add one station with songs in the dir path.
			 'r [station number]' : To dynamically remove one station with the specified station number.
			For crucial problems, the server will exist and report what error it encouters.

	Design: 
			Data Structure: 
				To maintain all informations, there exists mainly four types of linked lists.First is a global linked list which manage all client informations, the header is called client_info_manager, each client is represented as a client_info structure. The global linked list links all conneted clients, and records all their IP address, Port information, station number, etc.
