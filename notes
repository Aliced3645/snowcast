client: snowcast_listener(udp) snowcast_control(tcp)
server: snowcast_server

snowcast_control <-> snowcast_server:
	Hello <-> Welcome
	SetStation <-> Announce

server: for tcp and udp...How?
Solution: 
	1.Create a thread for listening connections...
	2.For each song, these is one thread?


for asynchronization method...

Select may contains a set of files with events,
then needs to iterate from 0 to max file discriptor to handle each file.
##Done

************************************
The server should record the address of each client, and also their current channel

address of client? from sockaddr to addr_info?

##Done

***************************************
Now the problem is :
1. UDP client will have to start to work.
2. Manage channel structure.
